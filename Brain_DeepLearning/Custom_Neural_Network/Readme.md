# Neural Network From Scratch with Custom Categorical Cross Entropy

## Abstract
In this assignment, a one hidden layer neural network model that adapts to the most suitable activation function according to the dataset is developed. The mathematical formulation of the activation function used in this method is $$g(x)  = k_0 + k_1x$$, where $$x, g(x) \in \textbf{R}$$, and  $$k_0, k_1$$ are learned from the data via gradient descent. The performance of the one hidden layer neural network model is evaluated on Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Iris, Bank Note Authentication, and MNIST datasets.
