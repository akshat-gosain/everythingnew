# MNIST VAE Project Overview

## What I've Done:
- Built a VAE to generate MNIST digit images.
- Trained the model on the MNIST dataset.

## Approach:
- Used PyTorch for the VAE model.
- Experimented with Gaussian (1,2), Normal, and Gamma (3,2) distributions for image generation.

## Why These Choices:
- Chose different distributions to see their effects on the output.
- Adjusted the loss function to try and enhance image quality.

## Results:
- The model generates varied digit images.
- Some tweaks to the loss function seemed to help with image clarity.
